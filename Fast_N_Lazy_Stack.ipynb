    "# Fast'n'lazy stack\n",
    "A funky stack that is lazy but fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "We have to implement 3 operations on a stack-like list structure: `push [value]`, `pop`, and an increment operation, `inc [i] [value]`, that adds `[value]` to the bottom `[i]` elements of the stack (`[value]` can be negative). For example, `inc 3 10` changes the bottom 3 data points in a stack as such:\n",
    "```\n",
    "| 5|      | 5| (top)\n",
    "| 4|      | 4|\n",
    "| 2|  =>  |12|\n",
    "| 2|      |12|\n",
    "| 3|      |13| (bottom)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The push and pop operations are fairly simple, but we want to make the increment operation \"lazy\". So, we'll need to modify them as we implement the increment operation such that we don't do any direct calculation on the stack values until the user actually reads data from the stack (i.e. peeks the top value).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that a lazy increment is an *optimization* that does less processing at the time that the instruction is recieved. We need do some accounting with a running sum of value increments at each applicable index. When the value is retrieved, we'll have an extra arithmetic operation that accounts for any past increment operation that should have been applied to it. This is supposed to be faster than adding the values to each of the bottom elements at the moment that the increment function is called, especially when you have a very large stack and many increments on a significant bottom portion of the stack."

    "In general, `inc i v` applies to stack elements at indices i-1 down to 0. The approach to make the increment lazy is to use another data structure to account for what values to increment and at which section indices. We \"save\" information from any increment instruction into this collection, and only apply the increment when data from the stack is needed. The extra expense\\* of this optimization is that it takes up more space: O(n) where n is the number of unique i of increments encountered in the instructions. The collection is a dictionary where each entry is of the format `{k: value}`, where `value` is the summation of all `value` in `inc k value` received for that specific `k`. To ensure the summation applies downward, we'll do the following...\n",
    "\n",
    "The `incs` dictionary is in lockstep with the the top of the stack. It also holds all various increments applicable to lower sections of the stack. Let's refer to the index at the top of the stack as `j`. If we have a 0-indexed stack, then j == length of the stack minus 1. When data from the top of the stack is accessed (i.e. peek), we will get the value from the top of the stack and add to it the value collected from all inc instruction that applies to it. Getting this value is simply the value at dictionary's key = length of stack. Whenever we pop the stack, we need to preserve the value increments in the dictionary by adding the value to the very next index/key down.\n",
